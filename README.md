# Unit 12 – Web Scraping Homework, Mission to Mars

The objective of this project is to build a web application using Flask that scrapes various websites for data on Mars and to display the information in a HTML page. The information on Mars is scraped from the web using BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Splinter, saved in a Mongo database, then extracted and displayed in the HTML page. 

The information collected and presented includes: the latest news title and paragraph text from the NASA Mars News site, the featured Mars image from the JPL Space Image site, the weather on Mars from the Mars Weather twitter account, facts about Mars from the Mars Facts site, and images of Mars’s hemispheres from the USGS Astrogeology site.
